This is a TODO plan for openDarkEngine

Each minor version has it's own plan piece, which can change as requirements will

(* marks todo, + marks a thing already implemented)

0.2.0 - 0.3.0:
	+ implement a file handling base classes 
	+ implement a dynamic data containers - (sortof - DTypeDef)
	- implement a templating service for binary data templates/instances handling (e.g. a library of binary templates)
	* implement a base of the object service (Property, Link and Object)
	* implement a LGMD .bin loader (online, resource manager?) that constructs a SceneNode tree and some specs of limits + rotating/sliding info
	* test all the previous by loading the game objects in-game
	* if considered a good idea, implement a base scripting bindings
	* Write a custom gui service, based on ogre's overlays. Or find one that fits (BetaGUI?)
	+ get rid of the temporary source code. That includes OpdeMission ad the ExampleApplication

0.3.0 - 0.4.0: (Just a sketch for now, will likely change)
	* AI object loading implementation (LGMM), including the movement database. Some tricks could be needed for the translation part of the movement
	* Physics service implementation
	* Particle service implementation



Detailed plan
-------------
The overall idea is to reproduce the DarkEngine system :)

The base is Services, each handling a different kind of engine function. On opde executable start, a configuration file is loaded, which should contain the specification of a bootstraping script to use (The main control script), resource configuration to use, files to use, etc. The result is that the core services are properly set-up, and bootstraping script is executed. This script then creates/duplicates the original game look and feel - gui's are set-up and displayed, movies are played.

Upon the game itself is started, another set of services is instantinated. The main script only handles game logic outside the gameplay - e.g. menu system, mission to mission sequence / zone loading in ss2. Also map/objectives are handled here (Simulation is paused while executing the bootstraping script).

The core game system should probably be two threads. One, stepped on 1 ms, simulation thread, handles script messages and timed messages - e.g. the game logic, another thread handles the renderer loop. This way, multi core systems get some bonus and, after all, this how the original system probably worked.

0.2.0:

The plan is to implement object system services. 

After that, a service that handles mesh object loading and display, which will be hooked as a notification client to the property notification system.

Configuration service
---------------------
A central register for configuration storage. Should have categories, each containing a set of key/value pairs
Abilities:
* Load a configuration from a given file/files.
* Uses Ogre::ConfigFile

Binary service
--------------
Should handle loading of structure definitions from a xml file, and organising them in groups. The service should have methods to get a certain structure definition. Should be based on the DTypeDef class. Based on telliamed's XML files, which will be modified to fit the binary service.

Property service
----------------
Should handle loading properties from the Mission definition, GAM system and savegames. The loader has to be prepared to understand the properties from
either Thief 1/Thief Gold/Thief 2 and System Shock 2. It should use Binary service as a source of data format descriptions. There should be a file containing the definitions of properties, their names, stored names, inheritance types. Configuration service should contain the path to the description file.

The property service should have these abilities:
* Notification of property - ADDITION, REMOVAL, CHANGE (call a list of methods registered to listen to the event). Per property type. This notification is fired even if the property addition/chage comes indirectly thanks to inheritance.
* Cacheing of property inheritance - Listening to the inheritance service notifications, it should remap the visibility and value source of given property (Priority based, as in MetaProperty link's data - priority)
* Inheritance definitions for each property type - as far as I know, there are these inheritance mechanims:
	- Normal inheritance - Property get's inherited every time
	- Archetype-only inheritance - Inheritance works only on archetypes. The property does not inherit into an object instance (ID>0). Dromed copies this property if instantinating an archetype. In-game, it should be ignored on metaproperty change.
* loading / writing of archetype, non-archetype and both to a given FileGroup
* Iterator on object self-properties (those not inherited). For editor use

Link service
------------
Responsible for link management. Uses binary service for link/link data loading. Link data are stored in binary for all the time. Links are remapped to more optimal structures.

Abilities:
* Link organisation in per-type storages.
* Link indexing - link name to link type ID, link type ID to link names
* Link manipulation - addition, removal, change of link and link data
* Link change notification - Addition, Removal, change of link or link data. Per link type
* Link queries - Different kinds of link queries - for example - get all mp links to pointing to the object ID X
* Link data manipulation - queries on link data values, data value changes
* Later on, link broadcasts (message distribution) - probably 0.3.0 task
* Link loaders/writers, and a central load/save. Both archetype-only, archetype-less and all links should be implemented. Storing to FileGroup.

Object service
--------------
Service responsible for object management.

Abilities:
* Object instantination, removal, slay. Upon instantination
     some object have to be given new instances of the archetype's linked objects (ParticleAttachment, weapon for creatures). 
     This should be probably done via Notifications to services responsible for that.
* Notification of object changes - Creation, Death, Pre-Death
* Object cloning - fabricate by example (copy object and links to it)
* OBJVEC (name?) handling - bitmap of available object ID's. Rescale upon filling to avoid DE's types of problems. Protected methods getFreeArchetypeID, getFreeObjectID.

- Copying of the links is somewhat special. Each link type knows if it has to be copied or not. Copying of properties is simmilar. Prop. service will have inheritance type on each property.


Inheritance Service (name this Trait Service?)
-------------------
High level service working with inheritance and archetype tree

Abilities:
* Metaproperty addition and removal
* Inheritance queries
* Archetype addition, removal, move in the tree
* Notification of inheritance changes
* Holds Normal/Metaproperty priorities for all objects. Adding metaprop will always give a new biggest number of priority for the new link. This means it would be wise to use InheritanceService, not link service directly for MP management.

- Property Service is hooked on the events of this service. Upon inheritance change, property service refreshes the current value for all affected properties of all affected objects. Usually, in-game, this will be limited to metaproperty addition/removal.

Renderer service(?)
* hooked on renderer properties, handle object display and mesh loading - the question here is if LGMD should be loaded as a SceneNode tree or a skeleton
based single mesh. Each has some positives and negatives.


0.3.0 and further

Scripting handlers - ScriptLanguage class, which handles script loading, execution, in-script class instance wrappers, service bindings
Implementation of ScriptLanguage for the chosen language. Then implementation of the bootstrapper code.
Message system.
Implementation of other services - physics, tweq, ai, etc.

Some unsorted todos:
--------------------
Sky - has to be rendered prior to static world geometry. Should be possible through renderSingleObject. This is waiting for T2-type sky to be written.
Collision system will have to be implemented ourselves
Tweq system - this will cause some problems - some tweqs only get updated if visible.
AI vision - do the vision cones work on WorldRep geometry or on room database? My bet is rooms.
Dynamic lights - as switchable lightmaps cover the lightning of unmovable lights, some approach has to be thinked up on dynamic lights, those are the only lightning world geometry too - shaders?



Some remarks:
-------------

GameService
-----------
The bootstrap script should control GameService. GameService would be a service doing the global engine functions. 
* Load/Save of savegames
* Mission loading
* Mission order (which mission is next)
* Game State Machine control (Which State would be next Movie1, Movie2, Main Menu...)
* Per frame updates? The order is cruical - physics, collisions, tweq, particle, AI.... This has to be determined, and fixed. Maybe some FrameUpdated class with order - int.
* Persistency of some values
* The state machine should be able to cooperate with script object(s)
* State registrations - register named GameState instances to be referenced by state changing calls


ScriptService
-------------
* Event dispatcher for in-game scripts
* Instance manager for script classes wrapped in C++ classes
* Instantinator/Registrator for such classes
* Uses ScriptLanguage instance to accomplish it's tasks.

The ScriptLanguage class, or simmilar named, would handle:
* script loading and execution
* static methods doing inter-language registration of types and classes (Services, etc.)
* Wrap the script's instances to a C++ instances for some classes - Script as a main example, also GameState and GUIManagedGameState (event callbacks)

GUIManagedState:
* Handles mouse cursor. Exposes method setupGUI instead of start(). setupGUI will be filled with gui building code and event bindings.

ScriptManagedState:
* A wrapper around script's instance. Gives the ability to manage the game state in some scripting language.

ScriptGUIManagedState:
* As ScriptManagedState, but including the GUIManagedState functions. Callbacks directly to the scripting level.
