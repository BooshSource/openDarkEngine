	/** Reference counter. A base class for all classes using reference counting approach. 
	* The addRef() method should be called every time a copy of the pointer to ref. counted class is made.
	* a release() should be called when throwing the pointer away. 
	* @note : the counter is intialized to 0, because some classes can allow changes of a certain type only on non-referenced instances, do not forget to call the addRef as soon as finished
	* @todo make the addref and release atomic operations (couldn't hurt, and is a must if we're gonna do multithreaded app) 
	* 
	* <b>Usage example</b><br>
	* <code>
	*  // First, I create some class which is reference counted<br>
	*  RefCClass* test = new RefCClass();<br>
	*  // now use the field definition as you like<br>
	*  //....<br>
	*  // and release after being finished<br>
	*<br>
	*  test->release();<br>
	* </code>*/
