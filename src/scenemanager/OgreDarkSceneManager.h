	/** BSP/Portal based scene manager.
	*
	* This sceneManager uses BSP tree and Portals. Each cell (leaf node of the BSP tree) is a convex cell, that is constructed with a 
	* set of textured polygons and portal polygons, which enclose the whole cell. The cells are convex pieces of geometry. For the portal
	* polygons, the visibility is evaluated, and if the portal is visible, the cell that is connected by the portal is rendered as well.
	*
	* @note This scene manager does not support portal movement, as the Intersection querries and visibility evaluators would have to be modified (and yet the modifying code would have to leave the cell convex and without holes)
