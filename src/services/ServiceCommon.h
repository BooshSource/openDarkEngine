To be used by service factories getMask() if the service want's to be a listener of particular service.
This does not do the registration of the listener itself, but will guarantee the service is constructed prior to data manipulations.
ServiceManager::createByMask() is used to create all the services given the mask before data manipulation takes place (typically in service's constructor).

The lower word of this 32bit unsigned integer is targetted at listener masking. The upper word is used for service ranges (core services, rendering services, game engine services)


I just hope we won't run out of mask bits! :D
