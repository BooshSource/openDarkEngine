-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in alpha release 0.0.2 (15-Dec-2005)

* Initial version

Changes in alpha release 0.0.3 (29-Dec-2005)

* Added OSM file manipulation base - DLL loader for linux, and some COM interfaces and implementation (IMalloc, IUnknown), plus some basic interfaces used by DLL loading
* Added console (without input now)
* Added ability to load D2 missions (tested on SS2, shall load Thief2 missions too - untested)
* Converted to DarkLib from class misfile (this will be used for loader in whole)
* Fixes

Changes in alpha release 0.1.0 (04-Jun-2006)
* Rewritten the whole thing to use Ogre3D
* CVS reinitialized

Changes in alpha release 0.1.1 (18-Jul-2006)
* added meshconvert application used to prepare the binary meshes to XML format used by Ogre3D importer
* added a trivial support for Widgets, and a not-yet-working console
* Fixes

Changes in alpha release 0.1.2 (29-Jul-2006)
* Rewritten the core renderer visibility testing routine - now more effective stack based approach 
* fixed a bug with water portals
* Applied a telliamed's patch

Changes in alpha release 0.1.3 (11-Aug-2006)
* Darklib was replaced with DarkDatabase class
* Fixed to work on AMD64 platform

Changes in alpha release 0.1.4 (20-Aug-2006)
* Added the ability to do lightmap switching
* Added a console command "light ID Intensity". Note that the ID differes from the object ID.

Changes in alpha release 0.1.5 (02-Sep-2006)
* The water portals are really fixed now. The rendering of water works, but needs to be finished.
* Updated the documentation of the sources. It should be pretty complete now.
* The material scripts can be used (and are searched) prior to the simple texture-only default materials. Not too complete for now.
* Water material script added. If not found, water should be invisible.
* Added -Werror compiler flag.

Changes in alpha release 0.1.6 (17-Sep-2006)
* SceneManager is nearly cleaned up (needs finishing though)
* Level geometry is loaded outside the SceneManager class, in a new (and first) Service called worldrep
* Water rendering finally works, the material should be tweaked to look better
* SkyHack seems to work well now
* The levels are currently non-lit (No lightmaps), as the lightmapping needs final fix.

Changes in alpha release 0.1.7 (2-Oct-2006)
* Water portals rendering works even with the lightmaps. The materials are bad though - not looking as they should.
* Added/restructuralised the materials
* Added OpdeService, OpdeServiceFactory and some more. These will hopefully be a base classes for the services.
* Lightmaps are partially fixed. Swiched on by default now.
* Pre-add of the StructInfo sources (Thanks telliamed!). These should form the binary service later on (for universal binary file access using binary templates)
* Some sky box work

Changes in alpha release 0.1.8 (7-Oct-2006)
* Header files put to the place where cpp files are, in hoping that this wil simplify orientation and building
* Converted from automake/autoconf to cmake
* Fixes to make compatible with VC++ and Mingw (Still some problems can/will emerge though)
* Restructuralisation of the directory tree. I hope this will be more meaningful

Changes in alpha release 0.1.9 (03-Dec-2006)
* Updated cmake scripts for both ogre and cegui, now the cmake will end up with an error when it does not find one of those
* Rewritten the renderer to use hardware buffers for static geometry and entities for water (major speed improvement)
* Attaching meshes to the scene now works (this means the object could be displayed if loading would be coded)
* added a logger
* minor fixes and changes
- skyhack does not work correctly for now, the skybox needs to be rendered before the geometry in order to work. Will be fixed

Changes in alpha release 0.2.0 (28-Jan-2006)
* Lightmap atlas can now be rectangular (not square only)
* Console now understands 'load_mission MISSION_FILE' command
* Console now understands 'show_portals X' command (X==1 shows visible portal geometry)
* RaySceneQuery and CollisionSceneQuery were implemented (the latter was not tested yet, may be malfunctioning or incomplete)
* fixed the loading of the world geometry (mission geometry can now be loaded online several times)
* added an cmake option to compile the OPDE_DEBUG code in (including LOG_DEBUG statements)
* Light map atlassing rewritten a bit. Now atlassing is done after all lightmaps are inserted, using a binary tree approach.
