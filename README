OpenDarkEngine (OPDE) readme
----------------------------

    OPDE was created as an effort to build a 
multiplatform engine supporting the LookingGlass'es (TM) 
data files from the original DarkEngine games.
So far, a basic display of levels work.

Requirements
------------
OPDE needs OGRE3D library in version 1.2.0 or 
newer and Devil image library (an ogre requirement).
Unfortunetly, the DevIL library needs a small patch 
to resolve the issue number 1211071 - too strict check 
of pcx headers. It is allready fixed in the CVS version,
so hopefully next release will be ok.


The structure of the sources
----------------------------
As of now, the sources are split into these directories:
DarkSceneManager - a scene manager rendering the level geometry, utilising the BSP-Portal structure of the WR/WRRGB chunk of the GAM files.
darkdb - The library of objects used for reading (and writing when implemented) of Tag Files
widgets - Directory, where the widgets reside - for example the display part of the console
tools - Mesh converter from the .bin format to .xml and .material, used by ogre (for in-game objects conversion)
console - The in-game console backend sources
services - The core in-game objects 

Building
--------
On *nix systems, building with (replace the OPDE_DIR with the directory in which the source resides) should be sufficient:
cd OPDE_DIR
./bootstrap
./configure
make

The windows build was not yet tested.


Running
-------
You will need to initialize resources.cfg, opde.cfg and plugins.cfg for the main executable to work.
see the opde wiki for more info:
