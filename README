OpenDarkEngine (OPDE) readme
----------------------------

This is a readme file for the OPDE project version 0.2.0

    OPDE was created as an effort to build a 
multiplatform engine supporting the LookingGlass'es (TM) 
data files from the original DarkEngine games.
So far, a basic display of levels work.

Requirements
------------
OPDE needs:
* OGRE3D library in version 1.2.0 or newer (but not >=1.3.0) and Devil image library (an ogre requirement, should be a part of SDK under windows).
* CEGUI (The part of Ogre SDK under windows, do not install separately) - 0.4 series
* CMake


Building
--------
On *nix systems, building with (replace the OPDE_DIR with the directory in which the source resides) should be sufficient:
cd OPDE_DIR
cmake .
make

On windows, please ensure that the OGRE_HOME environmental variables is set (should be if the installation was done using the ogre sdk).

If the cmake will have problem locating the CEGUI libs/headers, you can try setting these environmental variables:
SET CEGUI_HOME=/OgreSDK
SET CEGUI_EXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR=/OgreSDK/samples/include

Ensure, that MinGW/Visual C++ make systems are usable. (Cmake should test this first time it is run)

Then progress with (from commandline, being in the root directory of OPDE project):

cmake .

or, if wanting to select the generator (for example MinGW makefiles)

cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles"


Please read the output of cmake carefuly. If the makefiles/VC solution is not present, it will give you hints about what was wrong.

The result should be compilable by your system (VC / mingw32-make for mingw)

If you have a problem making for Mingw, please ensure that "sh" executable is NOT in path. If it is, and can't be relocated, select MSYS Makefiles rather than MinGW ones.


Running
-------
You will need to initialize resources.cfg, opde.cfg and plugins.cfg for the main executable to work.
see the opde wiki for more info:

Source code structure
---------------------
The main code resides in the 'src' subdirectory. The 'proto' directory contains some prototype code in the testing phase.

In the src directory, you can find:

    compat - Compiler compatibility headers
    base - base classes for the engine - logging, console backend, etc.
    scenemanager - the DarkSceneManager code, used to render BSP/Portal type of scenes
    services - The engine services, which will make up the engine itself
    tools - various tools - only meshconvert utility for now (LGMD -> .mesh xml converter)
    widgets - a widget implementations (GUI) - only console for now
