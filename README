OpenDarkEngine (OPDE) readme
----------------------------

This is a readme file for the OPDE project version 0.1.8

    OPDE was created as an effort to build a 
multiplatform engine supporting the LookingGlass'es (TM) 
data files from the original DarkEngine games.
So far, a basic display of levels work.

Requirements
------------
OPDE needs:
* OGRE3D library in version 1.2.0 or newer and Devil image library (an ogre requirement).
* CEGUI (The part of Ogre SDK under windows, do not install separately)
* CMake


Building
--------
On *nix systems, building with (replace the OPDE_DIR with the directory in which the source resides) should be sufficient:
cd OPDE_DIR
cmake .
make

On windows, please ensure that these environmental variables are set:
* OGRE_HOME
* CEGUI_HOME
* CEGUI_EXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR

If not, set them to point to the right directories
SET CEGUI_HOME=/OgreSDK
SET CEGUI_EXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR=/OgreSDK/samples/include

Ensure, that MinGW/Visual C++ make systems are in path

Then progress with (from commandline, being in the root directory of OPDE project):

cmake .

or, if wanting to select the generator (for example MinGW makefiles)

cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles"

The result should be compilable by your system (VC / mingw32-make for mingw)


Running
-------
You will need to initialize resources.cfg, opde.cfg and plugins.cfg for the main executable to work.
