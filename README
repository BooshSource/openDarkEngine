OpenDarkEngine (OPDE) readme
----------------------------

    OPDE was created as an effort to build a multiplatform engine supporting the LookingGlass'es (TM) data files from the original DarkEngine games.
So far, a basic display of levels work.



Package Versioning Schmeme:
---------------------------

Version numbers are divided into three parts, the major release
number, the minor release number and the patchlevel.  The version
number is appended to the name of the tarballs:

  <project>-<major>.<minor>.<patchlevel>.tar.gz

For example

  projectname-0.9.3.tar.gz

A change in the major release number indicates major changes in
the interfaces.  Between minor releases, every effort should be
made to keep the interfaces compatible.  The patchlevels indicate
the day to day work between the releases.  Odd minor release
numbers like 2.1.0 indicate unstable development releases while
even numbers like 2.4.0 indicate stable releases.
